My strengths are time management, overlooking things to optimize and correct mistakes, and programming

My values are adhering to laws, confidentiality, and ensuring policy

I like the cybersecurity field because nowadays everything is online and unfortunately we have so many hackers trying to steal our information The audience I hope to reach is professionals in the area of tech in general My ways of doing the job is the same as the guidelines of companies
